Velma.io is an intelligent engagement toolkit for applications or services.  Each tool can be invoked separately, or as part of an orchestrated communication strategy.

**[Velma.io](https://www.meetvelma.com/products/vfs)** is home to the Velma Fulfillment System, otherwise known as VFS.  The information on this site has been organized around supporting two primary users:

1. Solution Developers
2. Communication Administrators <small>([Get Started Here][1])</small>


The information should be both technical but practical for all readers.  [Postman][2] collections are available throughout the site when more in-depth technical information is required.
