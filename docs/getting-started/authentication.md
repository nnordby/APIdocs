VFS ensures your api calls are secure using multiple levels of security

1. JWT Token base authentication
2. API keys  
3. Sponsor and Client Keys

## JWT (Security Token)
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

VFS uses JWT token based authentication for API and VFS application security.  The token is generated by making a call to the VFS API and passed back into the VFS system by the customer application and verified before any internal processing can take place. The JWT token carries all the necessary information within its payload to be authorized for processing.

  * JWT does not hide or obscure data in any way
  * Data is created by an authentic source, encoded and signed
  * VFS verifies the authenticity of the source of the data

A username and password is provided for each sponsor if they are requesting a JWT token from the VFS system. They will need to be passed in the header of the **Generate JWT** call.

They are in the following form.

```json
jwtUsername: fcd523be205740b0b9e54f4d748f4d0f
jwtPassword: d6522bf09843470bab47ec56643499e2
```

## JWT Token Auth Workflow

* The assumption is that there is a Sponsor Application making the API calls
* A user of that application would "sign in" using their Sponsor username and password
* The Sponsor Application would make a call to a server on their side
* The server would generate the JWT token and pass it back to the application for use
* All the calls to the VFS system will then be made with that token + API Key

## Anatomy of a JWT Token

The token is broken down into 3 sections
1. Header - info about how the JWT signature should be computed
2. Payload - main payload of the token, also called claims
3. Signature - computed signature

### Header
```json
{
  “typ”: “JWT”,   
  “alg”: “HS256”
}
```
### Payload
```json
{
  "ver": "1.0",
  "apiKey": "49ep6U3OEH2UR56Dg4BNp6qKxNCnKeDP3l29cyZg”,
  "sponsorKey": "0a3c5aad8cfb496eae7966339a024965”,
    "clientKey": "DEMO6661549e4aa9811754bb29880cc9”,   
    "userName": "DEMOUSER”,
    "email": "demouser@mailinator.com”
    "iss": "DMO”,  
    "iat": 1515617562,
    "exp": 1516827162
}     
```

* *typ*: declaring type
* *alg*: algorithm used
* *ver*: provided following on-boarding used for VFS reference
* *apiKey*:  provided following on-boarding
* *sponsorKey*: provided following on-boarding
* *clientKey*: provided following on-boarding
* *userName*: reference userName
* *email*: reference Email (Useful if notifications are necessary)
* *iat*: issuer date/time: in unix time
* *exp*: expiry date/time: in unix time

### Signature

Formed from the Header, Payload and Secret

*The following is pseudo code representing how to create the signature*

```bash
var encodedString = base64UrlEncode(header) + "." + base64UrlEncode(payload);
HMACSHA256(encodedString, 'secret')
```

**Resulting Signature:**
```bash
-xN_h82PHVTCMA9vdoHrcZxH-x5mb11y1537t3rGzcM
```

So for example you may have a header of:

```bash
eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9
```

and a payload of:

```bash
eyJ1c2VySWQiOiJiMDhmODZhZi0zNWRhLTQ4ZjItOGZhYi1jZWYzOTA0NjYwYmQifQ
```

with signature of :

```bash
-xN_h82PHVTCMA9vdoHrcZxH-x5mb11y1537t3rGzcM
```
we combine all the components together resulting in the following JWT Token :

```bash
eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOiJiMDhmODZhZi0zNWRhLTQ4ZjItOGZhYi1jZWYzOTA0NjYwYmQifQ.-xN_h82PHVTCMA9vdoHrcZxH-x5mb11y1537t3rGzcM
```

### Verifying the JWT

  * The above example was signed by the HS256 algorithm ("alg”: “HS256”)
  * The VFS server and the sponsor application know the secret
  * VFS will verify the signature of the token using the secret
  * If signature matches then the the JWT token is Valid
  * If the signature is not valid then it views it as a potential attack
  * This ensures trust between an application and it's users

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## API KEY

Along with the JWT Token the Sponsor will also need an API Key to make all calls.

```json
a9fb4d11bb36466f98b2a70fe0fa9aa4
```

  * This key is provided and controlled by VFS
  * VFS can throttle or revoke the key if it finds abuse

During an API call the header will contain both JWT token and API Key

*Example API Call Header*
```bash
'Authorization': jwt eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOiJiMDhmODZhZi0zNWRhLTQ4ZjItOGZhYi1jZWYzOTA0NjYwYmQifQ.-xN_h82PHVTCMA9vdoHrcZxH-x5mb11y1537t3rGzcM
'x-api-key':   a9fb4d11bb36466f98b2a70fe0fa9aa4
'Content-Type': application/json
```

## Sponsor and Client Keys

  * To make calls post authentication, the token will need to contain a sponsor and client key
  * If the correct sponsor or client key aren't provided the call will fail

```bash
'Sponsor Key':  24134e7d7bf345e4bded4e9e0858fd6e
'Client Key': 9f1a3ea4689345e7b91f2169e44a3398
```

## Summary

For the VFS system to be compromised, the offending system or user would need to have the ability to produce a JWT Token with the known secret.  Additionally, they would need to know the correct API key, sponsor key and client key.  Even if they managed to obtain that information they would also need to know the correct product ID's associated with the sponsors client to make any impact.  Missing any of that information would result in a failed call.
