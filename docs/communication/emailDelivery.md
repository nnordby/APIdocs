The most important aspect of sending an email that a consumer engages with, is actually getting your message delivered.  That is why we take email authentication so seriously.  You can be sending a large volume of emails, but if they aren't getting delivered or are ending up in the Junk folder, you really aren't accomplishing your mission of reaching your audience with your important message.
