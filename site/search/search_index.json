However, as you write your documentation, you may reach a point where some small adjustments are necessary to preserve the desired style. Adding assets \u00b6 MkDocs provides several ways to interfere with themes. In order to make a few tweaks to an existing theme, you can just add your stylesheets and JavaScript files to the docs directory. Additional stylesheets \u00b6 If you want to tweak some colors or change the spacing of certain elements, you can do this in a separate stylesheet. The easiest way is by creating a new stylesheet file in your docs directory: 1 2 mkdir docs/stylesheets touch docs/stylesheets/extra.css Then, add the following line to your mkdocs.yml : 1 2 extra_css : - 'stylesheets/extra.css' Spin up the development server with mkdocs serve and start typing your changes in your additional stylesheet file \u2013 you can see them instantly after saving, as the MkDocs development server implements live reloading. Additional JavaScript \u00b6 The same is true for additional JavaScript. If you want to integrate another syntax highlighter or add some custom logic to your theme, create a new JavaScript file in your docs directory: 1 2 mkdir docs/javascripts touch docs/javascripts/extra.js Then, add the following line to your mkdocs.yml : 1 2 extra_javascript : - 'javascripts/extra.js' Further assistance can be found in the MkDocs documentation . Extending the theme \u00b6 If you want to alter the HTML source (e.g. add or remove some part), you can extend the theme. From version 0.16 on MkDocs implements theme extension , an easy way to override parts of a theme without forking and changing the main theme. Setup and theme structure \u00b6 Reference the Material theme as usual in your mkdocs.yml , and create a new folder for overrides, e.g. theme , which you reference using custom_dir : 1 2 3 theme : name : 'material' custom_dir : 'theme' Theme extension prerequisites As the custom_dir variable is used for the theme extension process, the Material theme needs to be installed via pip and referenced with the name parameter in your mkdocs.yml . The structure in the theme directory must mirror the directory structure of the original theme, as any file in the theme directory will replace the file with the same name which is part of the original theme. Besides, further assets may also be put in the theme directory. The directory layout of the Material theme is as follows: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 . \u251c\u2500 assets/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500 images/ # Images and icons \u2502 \u251c\u2500 javascripts/ # JavaScript \u2502 \u2514\u2500 stylesheets/ # Stylesheets \u251c\u2500 partials/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500 integrations/ # 3rd-party integrations \u2502 \u251c\u2500 language/ # Localized languages \u2502 \u251c\u2500 footer.html # Footer bar \u2502 \u251c\u2500 header.html # Header bar \u2502 \u251c\u2500 hero.html # Hero teaser \u2502 \u251c\u2500 language.html # Localized labels \u2502 \u251c\u2500 nav-item.html # Main navigation item \u2502 \u251c\u2500 nav.html # Main navigation \u2502 \u251c\u2500 search.html # Search box \u2502 \u251c\u2500 social.html # Social links \u2502 \u251c\u2500 source.html # Repository information \u2502 \u251c\u2500 tabs-item.html # Tabs navigation item \u2502 \u251c\u2500 tabs.html # Tabs navigation \u2502 \u251c\u2500 toc-item.html # Table of contents item \u2502 \u2514\u2500 toc.html # Table of contents \u251c\u2500 404 .html # 404 error page \u251c\u2500 base.html # Base template \u2514\u2500 main.html # Default page Overriding partials \u00b6 In order to override the footer, we can replace the footer.html partial with our own partial. To do this, create the file partials/footer.html in the theme directory. MkDocs will now use the new partial when rendering the theme. This can be done with any file. Overriding template blocks \u00b6 Besides overriding partials, one can also override so called template blocks, which are defined inside the Material theme and wrap specific features. To override a template block, create a main.html inside the theme directory and define the block, e.g.: 1 2 3 4 5 {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% block htmltitle %} <title>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</title> {% endblock %} The Material theme provides the following template blocks: Block name Wrapped contents analytics Wraps the Google Analytics integration content Wraps the main content disqus Wraps the disqus integration extrahead Empty block to define additional meta tags fonts Wraps the webfont definitions footer Wraps the footer with navigation and copyright header Wraps the fixed header bar hero Wraps the hero teaser htmltitle Wraps the <title> tag libs Wraps the JavaScript libraries, e.g. Modernizr repo Wraps the repository link in the header bar scripts Wraps the JavaScript application logic source Wraps the linked source files search_box Wraps the search form in the header bar site_meta Wraps the meta tags in the document head site_name Wraps the site name in the header bar site_nav Wraps the site navigation and table of contents social Wraps the social links in the footer styles Wraps the stylesheets (also extra sources) For more on this topic refer to the MkDocs documentation Theme development \u00b6 The Material theme uses Webpack as a build tool to leverage modern web technologies like Babel and SASS . If you want to make more fundamental changes, it may be necessary to make the adjustments directly in the source of the Material theme and recompile it. This is fairly easy. Environment setup \u00b6 In order to start development on the Material theme, a Node.js version of at least 8 is required. First, clone the repository: 1 git clone https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material Next, all dependencies need to be installed, which is done with: 1 2 3 cd mkdocs-material pip install -r requirements.txt npm install Development mode \u00b6 The development server can be started with: 1 npm run watch This will also start the MkDocs development server which will monitor changes on assets, templates and documentation. Point your browser to localhost:8000 and you should see this documentation in front of you. For example, changing the color palette is as simple as changing the $md-color-primary and $md-color-accent variables in src/assets/stylesheets/_config.scss : 1 2 $ md-color-primary : $ clr-red-400 ; $ md-color-accent : $ clr-teal-a700 ; Automatically generated files Never make any changes in the material directory, as the contents of this directory are automatically generated from the src directory and will be overriden when the theme is built. Build process \u00b6 When you've finished making your changes, you can build the theme by invoking: 1 npm run build This triggers the production-level compilation and minification of all stylesheets and JavaScript sources. When the command exits, the final theme is located in the material directory. Add the theme_dir variable pointing to the aforementioned directory in your original mkdocs.yml .

You can verify if you're already good to go with the following commands: 1 2 3 4 python --version # Python 2.7.13 pip --version # pip 9.0.1 Installing and verifying MkDocs is as simple as: 1 2 pip install mkdocs && mkdocs --version # mkdocs, version 0.17.1 Material requires MkDocs >= 0.17.1. Installing Material \u00b6 using pip \u00b6 Material can be installed with pip : 1 pip install mkdocs-material using choco \u00b6 If you're on Windows you can use Chocolatey to install Material : 1 choco install mkdocs-material This will install all required dependencies like Python and MkDocs . cloning from GitHub \u00b6 Material can also be used without a system-wide installation by cloning the repository into a subfolder of your project's root directory: 1 git clone https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material.git This is especially useful if you want to extend the theme and override some parts of the theme. The theme will reside in the folder mkdocs-material/material . Troubleshooting \u00b6 Installation on macOS When you're running the pre-installed version of Python on macOS, pip tries to install packages in a folder for which your user might not have the adequate permissions. There are two possible solutions for this: Installing in user space (recommended): Provide the --user flag to the install command and pip will install the package in a user-site location. This is the recommended way. Switching to a homebrewed Python : Upgrade your Python installation to a self-contained solution by installing Python with Homebrew. This should eliminate a lot of problems you may be having with pip . Error: unrecognized theme 'material' If you run into this error, the most common reason is that you installed MkDocs through some package manager (e.g. Homebrew or apt-get ) and the Material theme through pip , so both packages end up in different locations. MkDocs only checks its install location for themes. Alternative: Using Docker \u00b6 If you're familiar with Docker, the official Docker image for Material comes with all dependencies pre-installed and ready-to-use with the latest version published on PyPI, packaged in a very small image. Pull it with: 1 docker pull squidfunk/mkdocs-material The mkdocs executable is provided as an entrypoint, serve is the default command. Start the development server in your project root with: 1 docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 -v ${PWD}:/docs squidfunk/mkdocs-material If you're using Windows command prompt ( cmd.exe ), substitute ${PWD} with \"%cd%\" . Usage \u00b6 In order to enable the theme just add one of the following lines to your project's mkdocs.yml . If you installed Material using a package manager: 1 2 theme : name : 'material' If you cloned Material from GitHub: 1 2 3 theme : name : null custom_dir : 'mkdocs-material/material' MkDocs includes a development server, so you can review your changes as you go. The development server can be started with the following command: 1 mkdocs serve Now you can point your browser to http://localhost:8000 and the Material theme should be visible. From here on, you can start writing your documentation, or read on and customize the theme. Configuration \u00b6 Color palette \u00b6 A default hue is defined for every primary and accent color on Google's Material Design color palette , which makes it very easy to change the overall look of the theme. Just set the primary and accent colors using the following variables: 1 2 3 4 theme : palette : primary : 'indigo' accent : 'indigo' Color names are case-insensitive, but must match the names of the Material Design color palette. Valid values are: red , pink , purple , deep purple , indigo , blue , light blue , cyan , teal , green , light green , lime , yellow , amber , orange , deep orange , brown , grey , blue grey and white . The last four colors can only be used as a primary color. If the color is set via this configuration, an additional CSS file that defines the color palette is automatically included. If you want to keep things lean, clone the repository and recompile the theme with your custom colors set. See the guide on customization for more information. Primary colors \u00b6 Default: indigo Click on a tile to change the primary color of the theme: Red Pink Purple Deep Purple Indigo Blue Light Blue Cyan Teal Green Light Green Lime Yellow Amber Orange Deep Orange Brown Grey Blue Grey White var buttons = document.querySelectorAll(\"button[data-md-color-primary]\"); Array.prototype.forEach.call(buttons, function(button) { button.addEventListener(\"click\", function() { document.body.dataset.mdColorPrimary = this.dataset.mdColorPrimary; }) }) Accent colors \u00b6 Default: indigo Click on a tile to change the accent color of the theme: Red Pink Purple Deep Purple Indigo Blue Light Blue Cyan Teal Green Light Green Lime Yellow Amber Orange Deep Orange var buttons = document.querySelectorAll(\"button[data-md-color-accent]\"); Array.prototype.forEach.call(buttons, function(button) { button.addEventListener(\"click\", function() { document.body.dataset.mdColorAccent = this.dataset.mdColorAccent; }) }) Font family \u00b6 Default: Roboto and Roboto Mono By default the Roboto font family is included with the theme, specifically the regular sans-serif type for text and the monospaced type for code. Both fonts are loaded from Google Fonts and can be changed to other fonts, like for example the Ubuntu font family : 1 2 3 4 theme : font : text : 'Ubuntu' code : 'Ubuntu Mono' The text font will be loaded in weights 400 and 700 , the monospaced font in regular weight. If you want to load fonts from other destinations or don't want to use the Google Fonts loading magic, just set font to false : 1 2 theme : font : false Logo \u00b6 Default icon: school Your logo should have rectangular shape with a minimum resolution of 128x128, leave some room towards the edges and be composed of high contrast areas on a transparent ground, as it will be placed on the colored header bar and drawer. Simply create the folder docs/images , add your logo and embed it with: 1 2 theme : logo : 'images/logo.svg' Additionally, the default icon can be changed by setting an arbitrary ligature (or Unicode code point) from the Material Design icon font , e.g. 1 2 3 theme : logo : icon : 'cloud' Language \u00b6 Call for Contributions: Add languages/translations to Material Help translate Material into more languages - it's just one click and takes approximately 2 minutes : click here Localization \u00b6 Default: en Material for MkDocs supports internationalization (i18n) and provides translations for all template variables and labels in the following languages: Available languages ar / Arabic ca / Catalan cs / Czech da / Danish nl / Dutch en / English fi / Finnish fr / French gl / Galician de / German he / Hebrew hi / Hindi hr / Croatian hu / Hungarian id / Indonesian it / Italian ja / Japanese kr / Korean no / Norwegian fa / Persian pl / Polish pt / Portugese ru / Russian sr / Serbian sh / Serbo-Croatian sk / Slovak es / Spanish sv / Swedish zh / Chinese (Simplified) zh-Hant / Chinese (Traditional) zh-TW / Chinese (Taiwanese) tr / Turkish uk / Ukrainian vi / Vietnamese Submit a new language Specify the language with: 1 2 theme : language : 'en' If the language is not specified, Material falls back to English. To create a translation for another language, copy the localization file of an existing language, name the new file using the 2-letter language code and adjust all translations: 1 cp partials/language/en.html partials/language/jp.html Text direction \u00b6 Default: best match for given theme language, automatically set Material supports both, left-to-right ( ltr ) and right-to-left ( rtl ) text direction. This enables more languages like Arabic, Hebrew, Syriac and others to be used with the theme: 1 2 theme : direction : 'rtl' Site search \u00b6 Default: best match for given theme language, automatically set Site search is implemented using lunr.js , which includes stemmers for the English language by default, while stemmers for other languages are included with lunr-languages , both of which are integrated with this theme. Material selects the matching (or best-matching) stemmer for the given theme language. Multilingual search can be activated in your project's mkdocs.yml by explicitly defining the search language(s): 1 2 3 extra : search : language : 'en, de, ru' At the time of writing, the following languages are supported: Available language stemmers da / Danish du / Dutch en / English fi / Finnish fr / French de / German hu / Hungarian it / Italian jp / Japanese no / Norwegian pt / Portugese ro / Romanian ru / Russian es / Spanish sv / Swedish tr / Turkish MkDocs 1.0 compatibility While MkDocs 1.0 supports prebuilding the search index, Material currently doesn't support this setting as the default search behavior of the original theme was heavily modified for the sake of a better UX. Integration is possible, but a small subset of the features Material provides will not be portable to the prebuilt index mainly due to missing localization. Only specify the languages you really need Be aware that including support for other languages increases the general JavaScript payload by around 20kb (without gzip) and by another 15-30kb per language. The separator for tokenization can be customized which makes it possible to index parts of words that are separated by - or . : 1 2 3 extra : search : tokenizer : '[\\s\\-\\.]+' Favicon \u00b6 Default: assets/images/favicon.png The default favicon can be changed by setting the favicon variable to an .ico or image file: 1 2 theme : favicon : 'assets/images/favicon.ico' Features \u00b6 Tabs \u00b6 Default: false Material supports another layer on top of the main navigation for larger screens in the form of tabs. This is especially useful for larger documentation projects with only few top-level sections. Tabs can be enabled by setting the respective feature flag to true: 1 2 3 theme : feature : tabs : true Customization \u00b6 Adding a source repository \u00b6 To include a link to the repository of your project within your documentation, set the following variables via your project's mkdocs.yml : 1 2 repo_name : 'squidfunk/mkdocs-material' repo_url : 'https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material' The name of the repository will be rendered next to the search bar on big screens and as part of the main navigation drawer on smaller screen sizes. Furthermore, if repo_url points to a GitHub, BitBucket or GitLab repository, the respective service logo will be shown next to the name of the repository. Additionally, for GitHub, the number of stars and forks is shown. If the repository is hosted in a private environment, the service logo can be set explicitly by setting extra.repo_icon to github , gitlab or bitbucket . Why is there an edit button at the top of every article? If the repo_url is set to a GitHub or BitBucket repository, and the repo_name is set to GitHub or BitBucket (implied by default), an edit button will appear at the top of every article. This is the automatic behavior that MkDocs implements. See the MkDocs documentation on more guidance regarding the edit_uri attribute, which defines whether the edit button is shown or not. Adding social links \u00b6 Social accounts can be linked in the footer of the documentation using the automatically included FontAwesome webfont. The type must denote the name of the social service, e.g. github , twitter or linkedin and the link must contain the URL you want to link to: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 extra : social : - type : 'github' link : 'https://github.com/squidfunk' - type : 'twitter' link : 'https://twitter.com/squidfunk' - type : 'linkedin' link : 'https://linkedin.com/in/squidfunk' The links are generated in order and the type of the links must match the name of the FontAwesome glyph. The fa is automatically added, so github will result in fa fa-github . Adding a Web App Manifest \u00b6 A Web App Manifest is a simple JSON file that tells the browser about your web application and how it should behave when installed on the user's mobile device or desktop. You can specify a manifest in your mkdocs.yml : 1 2 extra : manifest : 'manifest.webmanifest' More advanced customization \u00b6 If you want to change the general appearance of the Material theme, see this article for more information on advanced customization. Integrations \u00b6 Google Analytics \u00b6 MkDocs makes it easy to integrate site tracking with Google Analytics. Besides basic tracking, clicks on all outgoing links can be tracked as well as how site search is used. Tracking can be activated in your project's mkdocs.yml : 1 2 3 google_analytics : - 'UA-XXXXXXXX-X' - 'auto' Disqus \u00b6 Material for MkDocs is integrated with Disqus , so if you want to add a comments section to your documentation set the shortname of your Disqus project in your mkdocs.yml : 1 2 extra : disqus : 'your-shortname' The comments section is inserted on every page, except the index page . Additionally, a new entry at the bottom of the table of contents is generated that is linking to the comments section. The necessary JavaScript is automatically included. Requirements site_url value must be set in mkdocs.yml for the Disqus integration to load properly. Disqus can also be enabled or disabled for specific pages using Metadata . Extensions \u00b6 MkDocs supports several Markdown extensions . The following extensions are not enabled by default (see the link for which are enabled by default) but highly recommended, so they should be switched on at all times: 1 2 3 4 5 6 markdown_extensions : - admonition - codehilite : guess_lang : false - toc : permalink : true For more information, see the following list of extensions supported by the Material theme including more information regarding installation and usage: Admonition Codehilite Footnotes Metadata Permalinks PyMdown Extensions Full example \u00b6 Below is a full example configuration for a mkdocs.yml : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 # Project information site_name : 'Material for MkDocs' site_description : 'A Material Design theme for MkDocs' site_author : 'Martin Donath' site_url : 'https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/' # Repository repo_name : 'squidfunk/mkdocs-material' repo_url : 'https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material' # Copyright copyright : 'Copyright &copy; 2016 - 2017 Martin Donath' # Configuration theme : name : 'material' language : 'en' palette : primary : 'indigo' accent : 'indigo' font : text : 'Roboto' code : 'Roboto Mono' # Customization extra : manifest : 'manifest.webmanifest' social : - type : 'github' link : 'https://github.com/squidfunk' - type : 'twitter' link : 'https://twitter.com/squidfunk' - type : 'linkedin' link : 'https://linkedin.com/in/squidfunk' # Google Analytics google_analytics : - 'UA-XXXXXXXX-X' - 'auto' # Extensions markdown_extensions : - admonition - codehilite : guess_lang : false - toc : permalink : true","title":"Getting started"},{"location":"getting-started/#getting-started","text":"","title":"Getting started"},{"location":"getting-started/#installation","text":"","title":"Installation"},{"location":"getting-started/#installing-mkdocs","text":"Before installing MkDocs , you need to make sure you have Python and pip \u2013 the Python package manager \u2013 up and running.

This is the recommended way. Switching to a homebrewed Python : Upgrade your Python installation to a self-contained solution by installing Python with Homebrew. This should eliminate a lot of problems you may be having with pip . Error: unrecognized theme 'material' If you run into this error, the most common reason is that you installed MkDocs through some package manager (e.g. Homebrew or apt-get ) and the Material theme through pip , so both packages end up in different locations.

You can verify if you're already good to go with the following commands: 1 2 3 4 python --version # Python 2.7.13 pip --version # pip 9.0.1 Installing and verifying MkDocs is as simple as: 1 2 pip install mkdocs && mkdocs --version # mkdocs, version 0.17.1 Material requires MkDocs >= 0.17.1. Installing Material \u00b6 using pip \u00b6 Material can be installed with pip : 1 pip install mkdocs-material using choco \u00b6 If you're on Windows you can use Chocolatey to install Material : 1 choco install mkdocs-material This will install all required dependencies like Python and MkDocs . cloning from GitHub \u00b6 Material can also be used without a system-wide installation by cloning the repository into a subfolder of your project's root directory: 1 git clone https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material.git This is especially useful if you want to extend the theme and override some parts of the theme. The theme will reside in the folder mkdocs-material/material . Troubleshooting \u00b6 Installation on macOS When you're running the pre-installed version of Python on macOS, pip tries to install packages in a folder for which your user might not have the adequate permissions. There are two possible solutions for this: Installing in user space (recommended): Provide the --user flag to the install command and pip will install the package in a user-site location. This is the recommended way. Switching to a homebrewed Python : Upgrade your Python installation to a self-contained solution by installing Python with Homebrew. This should eliminate a lot of problems you may be having with pip . Error: unrecognized theme 'material' If you run into this error, the most common reason is that you installed MkDocs through some package manager (e.g. Homebrew or apt-get ) and the Material theme through pip , so both packages end up in different locations. MkDocs only checks its install location for themes. Alternative: Using Docker \u00b6 If you're familiar with Docker, the official Docker image for Material comes with all dependencies pre-installed and ready-to-use with the latest version published on PyPI, packaged in a very small image. Pull it with: 1 docker pull squidfunk/mkdocs-material The mkdocs executable is provided as an entrypoint, serve is the default command. Start the development server in your project root with: 1 docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 -v ${PWD}:/docs squidfunk/mkdocs-material If you're using Windows command prompt ( cmd.exe ), substitute ${PWD} with \"%cd%\" . Usage \u00b6 In order to enable the theme just add one of the following lines to your project's mkdocs.yml . If you installed Material using a package manager: 1 2 theme : name : 'material' If you cloned Material from GitHub: 1 2 3 theme : name : null custom_dir : 'mkdocs-material/material' MkDocs includes a development server, so you can review your changes as you go. The development server can be started with the following command: 1 mkdocs serve Now you can point your browser to http://localhost:8000 and the Material theme should be visible. From here on, you can start writing your documentation, or read on and customize the theme. Configuration \u00b6 Color palette \u00b6 A default hue is defined for every primary and accent color on Google's Material Design color palette , which makes it very easy to change the overall look of the theme. Just set the primary and accent colors using the following variables: 1 2 3 4 theme : palette : primary : 'indigo' accent : 'indigo' Color names are case-insensitive, but must match the names of the Material Design color palette. Valid values are: red , pink , purple , deep purple , indigo , blue , light blue , cyan , teal , green , light green , lime , yellow , amber , orange , deep orange , brown , grey , blue grey and white . The last four colors can only be used as a primary color. If the color is set via this configuration, an additional CSS file that defines the color palette is automatically included. If you want to keep things lean, clone the repository and recompile the theme with your custom colors set. See the guide on customization for more information. Primary colors \u00b6 Default: indigo Click on a tile to change the primary color of the theme: Red Pink Purple Deep Purple Indigo Blue Light Blue Cyan Teal Green Light Green Lime Yellow Amber Orange Deep Orange Brown Grey Blue Grey White var buttons = document.querySelectorAll(\"button[data-md-color-primary]\"); Array.prototype.forEach.call(buttons, function(button) { button.addEventListener(\"click\", function() { document.body.dataset.mdColorPrimary = this.dataset.mdColorPrimary; }) }) Accent colors \u00b6 Default: indigo Click on a tile to change the accent color of the theme: Red Pink Purple Deep Purple Indigo Blue Light Blue Cyan Teal Green Light Green Lime Yellow Amber Orange Deep Orange var buttons = document.querySelectorAll(\"button[data-md-color-accent]\"); Array.prototype.forEach.call(buttons, function(button) { button.addEventListener(\"click\", function() { document.body.dataset.mdColorAccent = this.dataset.mdColorAccent; }) }) Font family \u00b6 Default: Roboto and Roboto Mono By default the Roboto font family is included with the theme, specifically the regular sans-serif type for text and the monospaced type for code. Both fonts are loaded from Google Fonts and can be changed to other fonts, like for example the Ubuntu font family : 1 2 3 4 theme : font : text : 'Ubuntu' code : 'Ubuntu Mono' The text font will be loaded in weights 400 and 700 , the monospaced font in regular weight. If you want to load fonts from other destinations or don't want to use the Google Fonts loading magic, just set font to false : 1 2 theme : font : false Logo \u00b6 Default icon: school Your logo should have rectangular shape with a minimum resolution of 128x128, leave some room towards the edges and be composed of high contrast areas on a transparent ground, as it will be placed on the colored header bar and drawer. Simply create the folder docs/images , add your logo and embed it with: 1 2 theme : logo : 'images/logo.svg' Additionally, the default icon can be changed by setting an arbitrary ligature (or Unicode code point) from the Material Design icon font , e.g. 1 2 3 theme : logo : icon : 'cloud' Language \u00b6 Call for Contributions: Add languages/translations to Material Help translate Material into more languages - it's just one click and takes approximately 2 minutes : click here Localization \u00b6 Default: en Material for MkDocs supports internationalization (i18n) and provides translations for all template variables and labels in the following languages: Available languages ar / Arabic ca / Catalan cs / Czech da / Danish nl / Dutch en / English fi / Finnish fr / French gl / Galician de / German he / Hebrew hi / Hindi hr / Croatian hu / Hungarian id / Indonesian it / Italian ja / Japanese kr / Korean no / Norwegian fa / Persian pl / Polish pt / Portugese ru / Russian sr / Serbian sh / Serbo-Croatian sk / Slovak es / Spanish sv / Swedish zh / Chinese (Simplified) zh-Hant / Chinese (Traditional) zh-TW / Chinese (Taiwanese) tr / Turkish uk / Ukrainian vi / Vietnamese Submit a new language Specify the language with: 1 2 theme : language : 'en' If the language is not specified, Material falls back to English. To create a translation for another language, copy the localization file of an existing language, name the new file using the 2-letter language code and adjust all translations: 1 cp partials/language/en.html partials/language/jp.html Text direction \u00b6 Default: best match for given theme language, automatically set Material supports both, left-to-right ( ltr ) and right-to-left ( rtl ) text direction. This enables more languages like Arabic, Hebrew, Syriac and others to be used with the theme: 1 2 theme : direction : 'rtl' Site search \u00b6 Default: best match for given theme language, automatically set Site search is implemented using lunr.js , which includes stemmers for the English language by default, while stemmers for other languages are included with lunr-languages , both of which are integrated with this theme. Material selects the matching (or best-matching) stemmer for the given theme language. Multilingual search can be activated in your project's mkdocs.yml by explicitly defining the search language(s): 1 2 3 extra : search : language : 'en, de, ru' At the time of writing, the following languages are supported: Available language stemmers da / Danish du / Dutch en / English fi / Finnish fr / French de / German hu / Hungarian it / Italian jp / Japanese no / Norwegian pt / Portugese ro / Romanian ru / Russian es / Spanish sv / Swedish tr / Turkish MkDocs 1.0 compatibility While MkDocs 1.0 supports prebuilding the search index, Material currently doesn't support this setting as the default search behavior of the original theme was heavily modified for the sake of a better UX. Integration is possible, but a small subset of the features Material provides will not be portable to the prebuilt index mainly due to missing localization. Only specify the languages you really need Be aware that including support for other languages increases the general JavaScript payload by around 20kb (without gzip) and by another 15-30kb per language. The separator for tokenization can be customized which makes it possible to index parts of words that are separated by - or . : 1 2 3 extra : search : tokenizer : '[\\s\\-\\.]+' Favicon \u00b6 Default: assets/images/favicon.png The default favicon can be changed by setting the favicon variable to an .ico or image file: 1 2 theme : favicon : 'assets/images/favicon.ico' Features \u00b6 Tabs \u00b6 Default: false Material supports another layer on top of the main navigation for larger screens in the form of tabs. This is especially useful for larger documentation projects with only few top-level sections. Tabs can be enabled by setting the respective feature flag to true: 1 2 3 theme : feature : tabs : true Customization \u00b6 Adding a source repository \u00b6 To include a link to the repository of your project within your documentation, set the following variables via your project's mkdocs.yml : 1 2 repo_name : 'squidfunk/mkdocs-material' repo_url : 'https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material' The name of the repository will be rendered next to the search bar on big screens and as part of the main navigation drawer on smaller screen sizes. Furthermore, if repo_url points to a GitHub, BitBucket or GitLab repository, the respective service logo will be shown next to the name of the repository. Additionally, for GitHub, the number of stars and forks is shown. If the repository is hosted in a private environment, the service logo can be set explicitly by setting extra.repo_icon to github , gitlab or bitbucket . Why is there an edit button at the top of every article? If the repo_url is set to a GitHub or BitBucket repository, and the repo_name is set to GitHub or BitBucket (implied by default), an edit button will appear at the top of every article. This is the automatic behavior that MkDocs implements. See the MkDocs documentation on more guidance regarding the edit_uri attribute, which defines whether the edit button is shown or not. Adding social links \u00b6 Social accounts can be linked in the footer of the documentation using the automatically included FontAwesome webfont. The type must denote the name of the social service, e.g. github , twitter or linkedin and the link must contain the URL you want to link to: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 extra : social : - type : 'github' link : 'https://github.com/squidfunk' - type : 'twitter' link : 'https://twitter.com/squidfunk' - type : 'linkedin' link : 'https://linkedin.com/in/squidfunk' The links are generated in order and the type of the links must match the name of the FontAwesome glyph. The fa is automatically added, so github will result in fa fa-github . Adding a Web App Manifest \u00b6 A Web App Manifest is a simple JSON file that tells the browser about your web application and how it should behave when installed on the user's mobile device or desktop. You can specify a manifest in your mkdocs.yml : 1 2 extra : manifest : 'manifest.webmanifest' More advanced customization \u00b6 If you want to change the general appearance of the Material theme, see this article for more information on advanced customization. Integrations \u00b6 Google Analytics \u00b6 MkDocs makes it easy to integrate site tracking with Google Analytics. Besides basic tracking, clicks on all outgoing links can be tracked as well as how site search is used. Tracking can be activated in your project's mkdocs.yml : 1 2 3 google_analytics : - 'UA-XXXXXXXX-X' - 'auto' Disqus \u00b6 Material for MkDocs is integrated with Disqus , so if you want to add a comments section to your documentation set the shortname of your Disqus project in your mkdocs.yml : 1 2 extra : disqus : 'your-shortname' The comments section is inserted on every page, except the index page . Additionally, a new entry at the bottom of the table of contents is generated that is linking to the comments section. The necessary JavaScript is automatically included. Requirements site_url value must be set in mkdocs.yml for the Disqus integration to load properly. Disqus can also be enabled or disabled for specific pages using Metadata . Extensions \u00b6 MkDocs supports several Markdown extensions . The following extensions are not enabled by default (see the link for which are enabled by default) but highly recommended, so they should be switched on at all times: 1 2 3 4 5 6 markdown_extensions : - admonition - codehilite : guess_lang : false - toc : permalink : true For more information, see the following list of extensions supported by the Material theme including more information regarding installation and usage: Admonition Codehilite Footnotes Metadata Permalinks PyMdown Extensions Full example \u00b6 Below is a full example configuration for a mkdocs.yml : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 # Project information site_name : 'Material for MkDocs' site_description : 'A Material Design theme for MkDocs' site_author : 'Martin Donath' site_url : 'https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/' # Repository repo_name : 'squidfunk/mkdocs-material' repo_url : 'https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material' # Copyright copyright : 'Copyright &copy; 2016 - 2017 Martin Donath' # Configuration theme : name : 'material' language : 'en' palette : primary : 'indigo' accent : 'indigo' font : text : 'Roboto' code : 'Roboto Mono' # Customization extra : manifest : 'manifest.webmanifest' social : - type : 'github' link : 'https://github.com/squidfunk' - type : 'twitter' link : 'https://twitter.com/squidfunk' - type : 'linkedin' link : 'https://linkedin.com/in/squidfunk' # Google Analytics google_analytics : - 'UA-XXXXXXXX-X' - 'auto' # Extensions markdown_extensions : - admonition - codehilite : guess_lang : false - toc : permalink : true","title":"Getting started"},{"location":"communication/getting-started/#getting-started","text":"","title":"Getting started"},{"location":"communication/getting-started/#installation","text":"","title":"Installation"},{"location":"communication/getting-started/#installing-mkdocs","text":"Before installing MkDocs , you need to make sure you have Python and pip \u2013 the Python package manager \u2013 up and running.

Installation \u00b6 Add the following lines to your mkdocs.yml : 1 2 markdown_extensions : - admonition Usage \u00b6 Admonition blocks follow a simple syntax: every block is started with !!! , followed by a single keyword which is used as the type qualifier of the block. The content of the block then follows on the next line, indented by four spaces. Example: 1 2 3 4 !!! note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result: Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Changing the title \u00b6 By default, the block title will equal the type qualifier in titlecase. However, it can easily be changed by adding a quoted string after the type qualifier. Example: 1 2 3 4 !!! note \"Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus\" Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla.

The highlighting process is executed during compilation of the Markdown file. Syntax highlighting not working? Please ensure that Pygments is installed. See the next section for further directions on how to set up Pygments or use the official Docker image with all dependencies pre-installed. Installation \u00b6 CodeHilite parses code blocks and wraps them in pre tags. If Pygments is installed, which is a generic syntax highlighter with support for over 300 languages , CodeHilite will also highlight the code block. Pygments can be installed with the following command: 1 pip install pygments To enable CodeHilite, add the following lines to your mkdocs.yml : 1 2 markdown_extensions : - codehilite Usage \u00b6 Specifying the language \u00b6 The CodeHilite extension uses the same syntax as regular Markdown code blocks, but needs to know the language of the code block. This can be done in three different ways. via Markdown syntax recommended \u00b6 In Markdown, code blocks can be opened and closed by writing three backticks on separate lines. To add code highlighting to those blocks, the easiest way is to specify the language directly after the opening block. Example: 1 2 3 ``` python import tensorflow as tf ``` Result: 1 import tensorflow as tf via Shebang \u00b6 Alternatively, if the first line of a code block contains a shebang, the language is derived from the path referenced in the shebang. This will only work for code blocks that are indented using four spaces, not for those encapsulated in three backticks. Example: 1 2 #!/usr/bin/python import tensorflow as tf Result: 1 2 #!/usr/bin/python import tensorflow as tf via three colons \u00b6 If the first line starts with three colons followed by a language identifier, the first line is stripped. This will only work for code blocks that are indented using four spaces, not for those encapsulated in three backticks. Example: 1 2 :::python import tensorflow as tf Result: 1 import tensorflow as tf Adding line numbers \u00b6 Line numbers can be added by enabling the linenums flag in your mkdocs.yml : 1 2 3 markdown_extensions : - codehilite : linenums : true Example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ``` python \"\"\" Bubble sort \"\"\" def bubble_sort(items): for i in range(len(items)): for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i): if items[j] > items[j + 1]: items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j] ``` Result: 1 2 3 4 5 6 \"\"\" Bubble sort \"\"\" def bubble_sort ( items ): for i in range ( len ( items )): for j in range ( len ( items ) - 1 - i ): if items [ j ] & gt ; items [ j + 1 ]: items [ j ], items [ j + 1 ] = items [ j + 1 ], items [ j ] Grouping code blocks \u00b6 The SuperFences extension which is part of the PyMdown Extensions package adds support for grouping code blocks with tabs. This is especially useful for documenting projects with multiple language bindings. Example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 ``` bash tab=\"Bash\" #!/bin/bash echo \"Hello world!\" ``` ``` c tab=\"C\" #include <stdio.h> int main(void) { printf(\"Hello world!\\n\"); } ``` ``` c++ tab=\"C++\" #include <iostream> int main() { std::cout << \"Hello world!\" << std::endl; return 0; } ``` ``` c# tab=\"C#\" using System; class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { Console.WriteLine(\"Hello world!\"); } } ``` Result: Bash 1 2 3 #!/bin/bash echo \"Hello world!\" C 1 2 3 4 5 #include <stdio.h> int main ( void ) { printf ( \"Hello world! \\n \" ); } C++ 1 2 3 4 5 6 #include <iostream> int main () { std :: cout << \"Hello world!\" << std :: endl ; return 0 ; } C# 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 using System ; class Program { static void Main ( string [] args ) { Console . WriteLine ( \"Hello world!\" ); } } Highlighting specific lines \u00b6 Specific lines can be highlighted by passing the line numbers to the hl_lines argument placed right after the language identifier. Line counts start at 1. Example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ``` python hl_lines=\"3 4\" \"\"\" Bubble sort \"\"\" def bubble_sort(items): for i in range(len(items)): for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i): if items[j] > items[j + 1]: items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j] ``` Result: 1 2 3 4 5 6 \"\"\" Bubble sort \"\"\" def bubble_sort ( items ): for i in range ( len ( items )): for j in range ( len ( items ) - 1 - i ): if items [ j ] & gt ; items [ j + 1 ]: items [ j ], items [ j + 1 ] = items [ j + 1 ], items [ j ] Supported languages excerpt \u00b6 CodeHilite uses Pygments , a generic syntax highlighter with support for over 300 languages , so the following list of examples is just an excerpt.

Read the documentation for usage notes . Caret \u00b6 Caret makes it possible to highlight inserted text . The portion of text that should be marked as added must be enclosed in two carets ^^...^^ . Critic \u00b6 Critic implements Critic Markup , a Markdown extension that enables the tracking of changes (additions, deletions and comments) on documents. During compilation of the Markdown document, changes can be rendered (default), accepted or rejected. Text can be deleted and replacement text added . This can also be combined into one a single operation. Highlighting is also possible and comments can be added inline . Formatting can also be applied to blocks, by putting the opening and closing tags on separate lines and adding new lines between the tags and the content. Details \u00b6 Details adds collapsible Admonition-style blocks which can contain arbitrary content using the HTML5 details and summary tags. Additionally, all Admonition qualifiers can be used, e.g. note , question , warning etc.: How many Prolog programmers does it take to change a lightbulb? Yes. Emoji \u00b6 Emoji adds the ability to insert a -load of emojis that we use in our daily lives. See the EmojiOne demo for a list of all available emojis. Happy scrolling Legal disclaimer Material has no affiliation with EmojiOne which is released under CC BY 4.0 . When including EmojiOne images or CSS, please read the EmojiOne license to ensure proper usage and attribution. InlineHilite \u00b6 InlineHilite adds support for inline code highlighting. It's useful for short snippets included within body copy, e.g. var test = 0 ; and can be achived by prefixing inline code with a shebang and language identifier, e.g. #!js . MagicLink \u00b6 MagicLink detects links in Markdown and auto-generates the necessary markup, so no special syntax is required. It auto-links http[s]:// and ftp:// links, as well as references to email addresses. Mark \u00b6 Mark adds the ability to highlight text like it was marked with a text marker . The portion of text that should be highlighted must be enclosed in two equal signs ==...== . SmartSymbols \u00b6 SmartSymbols converts markup for special characters into their corresponding symbols, e.g. arrows (\u2190, \u2192, \u2194), trademark and copyright symbols (\u00a9, \u2122, \u00ae) and fractions (\u00bd, \u00bc, ...). SuperFences \u00b6 SuperFences provides the ability to nest code blocks under blockquotes, lists and other block elements, which the Fenced Code Blocks extension from the standard Markdown library doesn't parse correctly. SuperFences does also allow grouping code blocks with tabs . Tasklist \u00b6 Tasklist adds support for styled checkbox lists. This is useful for keeping track of tasks and showing what has been done and has yet to be done. Checkbox lists are like regular lists, but prefixed with [ ] for empty or [x] for filled checkboxes. Example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 * [x] Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit * [x] Nulla lobortis egestas semper * [x] Curabitur elit nibh, euismod et ullamcorper at, iaculis feugiat est * [ ] Vestibulum convallis sit amet nisi a tincidunt * [x] In hac habitasse platea dictumst * [x] In scelerisque nibh non dolor mollis congue sed et metus * [x] Sed egestas felis quis elit dapibus, ac aliquet turpis mattis * [ ] Praesent sed risus massa * [ ] Aenean pretium efficitur erat, donec pharetra, ligula non scelerisque * [ ] Nulla vel eros venenatis, imperdiet enim id, faucibus nisi Result: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit Nulla lobortis egestas semper Curabitur elit nibh, euismod et ullamcorper at, iaculis feugiat est Vestibulum convallis sit amet nisi a tincidunt In hac habitasse platea dictumst In scelerisque nibh non dolor mollis congue sed et metus Sed egestas felis quis elit dapibus, ac aliquet turpis mattis Praesent sed risus massa Aenean pretium efficitur erat, donec pharetra, ligula non scelerisque Nulla vel eros venenatis, imperdiet enim id, faucibus nisi Tilde \u00b6 Tilde provides an easy way to strike through cross out text.

Tokens are a powerful way of creating hyper-personalized messaging to a recipient (contact) using the data provided in the command packet. Supported Tags \u00b6 This document describes the new vf-vars and token operations now supported by the token service. Note the vfvar (no hyphen) tokens are separate and not impacted by the vf-vars. Legacy Tokens \u00b6 There are 2 legacy tokens supported by the tokenService: Insert Token : @@TOKEN@@ Replace Token : {{TOKEN}} Insert Token \u00b6 The insert token is used to pull data from a URL and place it into the active document. The operations starts by finding the token. The search pattern is @@[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+@@ . The value between the @@ symbols are used to lookup a value in the command packet sent with the request. It is expected that the value in the command packet will be a URL. The system will fetch the content of that url and then replace the token, including the @@ symbols. Example: 1 < div > @@document.contactArea@@ </ div > Replace Token \u00b6 The replace token is used to put data from a command packet into the active document. The operation starts by finding the token. The search pattern is {{[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+}} . The value between the {{ symbols are used to lookup a value in the command packet sent with the request. It is expected that the value is string content: text or html. The system will take that data and replace the token, including the }} symbols. Example: 1 < div > Hello, {{user.firstName}} </ div > VFS Variables (vf-var) \u00b6 VFS Variables are smarter tokens. All VFS Variables are implemented as html attributes and function in different ways depending on the target node and the specific VFS Variable used. Each of these tokens will hold a value that references a path in the command packet . The command packet value will be used in a specific operation depending on the vfs variable but effect the html node to which the vfs variable is applied. [vf-insert] - Replaces the innerHtml of the node with data retrieved from a URL. [vf-show] - Hides hides the html node if the value in cp is empty or missing. [vf-html] - Sets the innerHtml. [vf-text] - Sets the innerText. [vf-title] - Sets title attribute [vf-class] - Append to the class attribute [vf-style] - Append to the style attribute img[vf-src] - Sets an image tag's src attribute img[vf-alt] - Sets an image tag's alt text attribute progress[vf-value] - Sets a progress's bar value attribute a[vf-href] - Sets an anchor tag's href attribute a[vf-tel] - Sets an anchor tag's href attribute using pattern \"tel:%s\" a[vf-mailto] - Sets an anchor tag's href attribute using pattern \"mailto:%s\" a[vf-thumb] - Sets an anchor tag's href attribute using pattern \"https://.../%s/document.thumb\" a[vf-preview] - Sets an anchor tag's href attribute using pattern \"https://.../%s/document.preview.1\" a[vf-output] - Sets an anchor tag's href attribute using pattern \"https://.../%s/finalOutput\" img[vf-thumb] - Sets an image tag's src attribute using pattern \"https://.../%s/document.thumb\" img[vf-preview] - Sets an image tag's src attribute using pattern \"https://.../${stage}/%s/document.preview.1\" Several aliases exist to simplify document creation: [vf-var] points to [vf-html] img[vf-ref] points to img[vf-src] a[vf-ref] points to a[vf-href] a[vf-mail] points to a[vf-mailto] [vfVar] points to *[vf-text] img[vfVar] points to img[vf-src] a[vfVar] points to a[vf-href] Note: a[vfVar] has special handing for tel and mailto values.

They extract data from the command packet , manipulate it, then set the resulting value into a attribute, text, or html on the current node. vfVar 's are different. This is vfVar , NOT vf-var . *[vfVar] simply places the value found in the command packet at the referenced path into the innerText of the node to which the attribute was applied. This is identical behavor to *[vf-text] . The exception to this rule is if the tag is a <img /> or <a /> . img[vfVar] will still pull the value from the command packet but, rather then setting the innerText, it will set the src attribute of the image tag. This is identical behavior to img[vf-src] . a[vfVar] will still pull the value from the command packet but, rather then setting the innerText, it will set the href attribute of the anchor tag. Additionally, the value set on the href attribute might be altered if the value currently in the href attribute (that is the value that exists before tokenization) starts with tel: or mailto: . If either of these strings are set, the system will maintain the prefix. Example: 1 < a vfVar = 'user.phone' href = 'tel:5555555555' > Call me </ a > Assuming the command packet has a value user.phone=\"1234567890\", the resulting string from the above example will read as follows. 1 < a vfVar = 'user.phone' href = 'tel:1234567890' > Call me </ a >","title":"Command Packet Tokens"},{"location":"getting-started/commandpacket-tokens/#supported-tags","text":"This document describes the new vf-vars and token operations now supported by the token service.

They are HTML and/or text which, when invoked by a command packet, can intelligently transform themselves into a robust communication message tailored for each senders targeted recipient(s). Simple Happy Birthday Email Command Packet & Products \u00b6 The command packet data and the product tokens are used in two ways: Tokens are replaced by the data in the command packet. The data is used to dynamically transform the product. Simple Tokens \u00b6 1 2 {{user.fullname}} {{user.title}} Smart Tokens \u00b6 These are tokens that show based on the existence of a value. 1 2 3 < div vf-show = \"user.fullname\" > Hi < span vf-var = \"user.fullname\" > John Smith </ span > </ div > Note What this means is that you must construct the product to facilitate your custom communication. Use Cases \u00b6 There are really two distinct types of use cases. One-to-One Communication (Transactional) \u00b6 The setup of the product is designed to target its contact or contacts based solely on the data outside the contact node.

Making a real connection with your audience for the purpose of driving engagement is behind the technology that has been created. Making the message intelligent so that it speaks to the specific individual it is reaching should be the goal of each message that has been created. We'll explore the different tools that are available to help you achieve this goal. Individual documents that represent the communication message being delivered to an end consumer are called Products, and Products, collectively, make up a client or sponsor Library. The Product page gives you the ability to manage and curate your content by letting you quickly filter by media type (print, email, SMS, etc), communication classification (marketing, transaction, notification, campaign), and tags you may have assigned to the product. From this page you can select a product to edit or add a new product from scratch. Products can be created from Templates which help drive the common elements from which a product is produced. For example, if a set of products are going to be created that share a common style or graphic, a Template can be built that provides a framework, or 'template', that can make the creation of a lot of products with shared elements quick and easy.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"libraries/productAttributes/","text":"Document elements and what they mean and how they interact with each other. 1.
